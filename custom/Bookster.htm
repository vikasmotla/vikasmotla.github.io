                        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing
 and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard 
dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley 
of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived 
not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with 
the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
 recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker 
including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
